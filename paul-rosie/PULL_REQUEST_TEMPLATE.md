#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Paul and Rosie paired together. It took about 2.5 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on looking over the existing codebase and reviewing comments and reviews.
  2. Next, we reviewed the Article.fetchAll function and worked to implement an Ajax call for retreiving data from local storage ELSE pull from hackerIpsum.json.
  3. Last, we tested in live-server and discussed potential solutions with peers. Project is complete.
